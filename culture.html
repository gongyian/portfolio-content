            <p>
                Hongyadong has witnessed the tides of history and weathered the centuries to blossom into the huge tourist attraction it is today.  
                Until around merely 20 years ago, Hongyadong was home to the working class of Chonqing and its distinctive stilted buildings (unique to Southwestern China)
            </p>


            <p>
                Hongyadong also named Hongya Gate before, which was one of the oldest gates in Chongqing in the past. 
                It is located at Cangbai Road, which is the intersection riverside zone of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. 
                The incredible place has another name of  “a stilted building on the cliff, and the old Chongqing in memories”.
                 In the meanwhile, it is an eye-catching building community featured with Bayu culture.
