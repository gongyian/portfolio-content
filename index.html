                Chongqing municipality consists of three lobes of unequal size extending southwest, northeast and southeast. 
                The districts of central Chongqing city occupy the southwestern lobe and are ringed by suburban districts. 
                From there the northeastern arm spreads along the Yangtze valley. 
                The southeastern lobe, stretching southeastward from the Yangtze valley, consists of a series of hills and valleys between Hunan and Guizhou; 
                the Wu River (another tributary of the Yangtze) runs roughly along the southwestern side of the lobe until it veers south into Guizhou.

                I would like to specifically introduce the special cuisine, the magical subway, and the unique culture of Chongqing. 
                Chongqing is expecially famous with spicy hotpot, with travellers saying "you could find hotpot in every street in Chongqing". 
                But Chongqing also has other delicious food like chongqing noodles, special rice-cake, spicy frog and so on. 
                Chongqing is also famous for its wonderful subways systems. Due to the number of mountains Chongqing has, the subways need to build across 
                those mountains and residence buildings, which creates a very unique scene of how subways submerged in people's daily life.
